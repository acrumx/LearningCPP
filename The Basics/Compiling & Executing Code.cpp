// The below is what you would type into the terminal to compile & execute the C++ file.
// Important thing to take note of: The computer itself does not know C++, you
// will be turning it into machine code (binary). 

// You must have the terminal's current working directory, set to the same as 
// that of the C++ program you are trying to compile and execute. 

// g++ gallus.cpp <- This will take the C++ file, compile it (resulting in an a.out file)
// ./a.out <- This will execute the a.out file you compiled.
